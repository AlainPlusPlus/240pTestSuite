                 CONVERGENCE TESTS

These are used to adjust color convergence in CRT 
displays.

- Button 'I' changes the pattern between cross hatch
lines, crosses, dots and a color pattern with or
without a black grid, for transition boundary check.

- Left and Right on the D-Pad allow cycling between
patterns.

- You can change the resolution with SELECT.
