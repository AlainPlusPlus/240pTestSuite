                  CHECKERBOARD

This pattern shows all the visible pixels in an
alternating b&w grid array.

- You can switch between all supported resolutions
with SELECT.

- You can toggle the pattern with L/R, or turn
on auto-toggle each frame with button I.

When auto-toggle is set, you should see it
alternating rapidly. On some setups, the pattern
doesn't change at all. This means that the signal
is being treated as interlaced.

- A frame counter can be displayed on screen by
pressing up on the d-pad.
