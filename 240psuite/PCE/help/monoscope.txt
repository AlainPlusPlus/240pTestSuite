                 MONOSCOPE (1/2)

This pattern contains elements to calibrate multiple
aspects of a CRT.

Read your monitor's service manual to learn how, and
use 'A' button to change IRE.

Brightness adjustment: Adjust convergence at low
brightness (13/25 IRE). An overly bright pattern can
mask convergence issues.

Convergence: Use the center crosshair to check static
(center of screen) convergence. Use the patterns at
the sides to check dynamic (edge) convergence.

Corners: After setting center and edge convergence,
use magnets to adjust corner purity and geometry.


                 MONOSCOPE (2/2)

Size and aspect ratio: If vertical and horizontal size
are correct, the red squares in the pattern will be
perfect squares. After setting H size, use a tape
measure to adjust V size to match it.

Linearity: The squares in each corner should get you
started. Confirm your adjustment using the scroll
tests.
