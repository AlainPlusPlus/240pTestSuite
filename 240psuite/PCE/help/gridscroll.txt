                 GRID SCROLL TEST


A grid is scrolled vertically or horizontally,
which can be used to test linearity of the signal
and how well the display or video processor copes
with scrolling and framerate.

- Button I can be used to toggle between horizontal
and vertical scroll, while the d-pad up or down
regulates speed.

- D-pad left or right changes direction.

- You can change the resolution with SELECT.
