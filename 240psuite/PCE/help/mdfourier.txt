                  MDFourier

This test generates a series of audio signals that
are to be recorded and analyzed for comparison
with the MDFourier tool on a PC.

This allows detailed comparison of the signal
as generated by this system.

You can press SELECT to run a clipping test which
runs all channels simultaneously.
