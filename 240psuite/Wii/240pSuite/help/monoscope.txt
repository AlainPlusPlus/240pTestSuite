                 MONOSCOPE (1/4)

The Monoscope Pattern is the traditional tool
for calibrating CRTs. This version aims to
provide several key elements to ensure you make
informed decisions about Convergence and 
Deflection. Refer to your monitor service manual
for procedures and safety equipment. 

1. #CBrightness Adjustable Pattern#C. Electron Gun
Alignment, or Convergence, is usually adjusted
with a lowered brightness. Full brightness can
mask issues with excessive bloom, especially 
if your peak white is too high. You can double
check your adjustments against the 30IRE pattern.
                                         #C(cont...)#C
                 MONOSCOPE (2/4)

2. #CStatic/Center Convergence#C. The center crosshair
is used to evaluate static or center screen
convergence. 

3. #CDynamic/Edge#C can be evaluated with the patterns
on the side of the screen.

4. #CCorner Convergence#C, corner purity and corner
geometry are tightly linked. Static and Dynamic
convergence must be set first before magnets can
successfully correct corner issues.


                                         #C(cont...)#C
                 MONOSCOPE (3/4)

5. #CAspect Ratio#C. A new feature to help set VSIZE
and HSIZE correctly is the red squares embedded in
the pattern. They are calculated to display as
perfect squares on a properly setup display.
You may want to start with a small amount of
horizontal overscan, then use a tape measure to
adjust VSIZE such that the outside edges of the
red square are the same in width and height.
This usually achieves an amount of overscan that
preserves the Title Safe Area. Some games may not
adhere to those boundaries, but most do.


                                         #C(cont...)#C
                 MONOSCOPE (4/4)

6. #CLinearity#C. Is the hardest part of the deflection
circuit. Scrolling tests are the best way to
confirm good Linearity but some compensated square
elements have added to each corner where a tape
measure may help get you started.

You can press $R and $L buttons to advance in 10 IRE
steps in the selected range.
