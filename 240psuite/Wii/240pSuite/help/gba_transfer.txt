      GBA 160p test Suite via Link Cable

This tool allows the transfer of pinobatch's
port of the Suite to Game Boy Advance.

You need to have a link cable connected to a
controller port and the GBA turned on without
a catridge.

The GBA ROM will be transferred and you'll be
able to use the software even with the cable
detached, until you turn off the system.
