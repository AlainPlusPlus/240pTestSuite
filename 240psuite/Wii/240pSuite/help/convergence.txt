                 CONVERGENCE TESTS

These are used to adjust color convergence in CRT 
displays.

- Button 'A' changes the pattern between cross
hatch lines, crosses, dots and a color pattern 
with or without a black grid, for transition 
boundary check.

- Left and Right on the D-Pad allow cycling 
between patterns.
