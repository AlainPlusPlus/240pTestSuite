               EBU COLOR BARS (2/2)

The EBU color bar pattern has seven vertical bars
of 100% or 75% intensity. In order from left to
right, the colors are gray, yellow, cyan, green,
magenta, red, and blue.

This sequence runs through all seven possible
combinations that use at least one of the three
basic color components of green, red, and blue,
with blue cycling on and off between every bar,
red cycling on and off every two bars, and green
on for the leftmost four bars and off for the
rightmost three.
