                    MDFOURIER

This test generates a series of audio signals that
are to be recorded and analyzed for comparison
with the #CMDFourier#C tool on a computer.

This allows detailed comparison of the signal as
generated by this system.

On #CDreamcast#C, the Audio Equipment test is used and
the samples are played back by the #GYamaha AICA#G.

Button #CX#C allows changing the sample rate.
