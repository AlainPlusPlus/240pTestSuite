                   COLOR BLEED 

This pattern helps diagnose unneeded color
up-sampling.

It consists of one pixel width color bars
alternating with one pixel width black bars.

You can change the vertical bars to a checker
board with the #GA#G button.

There are also higher resolution versions
when using 480i and 480p.
