            COLOR BARS WITH GRAY SCALE

This pattern idea and layout borrows from the 
#CDigital Video Essentials#C color adjust pattern.

It has a gray background as reference, and can 
be used with #Ccolor filters#C in order to adjust 
color accuracy. If your TV set has a blue only
mode, you can also use that to correct color
balance.
