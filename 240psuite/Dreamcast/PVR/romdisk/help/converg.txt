                 CONVERGENCE TESTS

These are used to adjust color convergence in #CCRT 
displays#C.

- Button #YA#Y changes the pattern between cross
hatch lines, crosses, dots and a color pattern 
with or without a black grid, for transition 
boundary check.

- Left and Right on the #YD-Pad#Y allow cycling 
between patterns.
