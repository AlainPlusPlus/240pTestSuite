                HCFR PATTERNS (1/7)

The #YHCFR Colormeter#Y software allows for profiling
and calibration of displays using the combination
of a pattern generator to create test patterns,
and a #Ctristimulous colorimeter#C to read and
measure the outputs. Then you, as the user, will
have to change settings on your display in order
to refine the results and attempt to match the
chosen standard of video color reproduction.

The #YHCFR Colormeter#Y software is at the heart
of the system. It interprets the results from the
colorimeter and provides #CCIE color#C differences
(Delta E values), chromaticity diagrams, gamma

curves and other values to assist you in
profiling and calibrating your display.

To set up #YHCFR Colormeter#Y, attach your colorimeter
to your computer, open the program, click
#CFile -> New#C, and select DVD Manual as your
selected generator. Select your colorimeter
from the list, and click OK.

Once in #YHCFR Colormeter#Y, click
#CAdvance -> Preferences#C.

Under the #CGeneral#C tab, ensure that the section
#CColors to add when measuring primaries and
secondaries#C is set to #YWhite#Y. 

Under the #CReferences#C tab, choose your color
space. #YPAL/SECAM#Y is recommended for #CPAL CRT#C
users. #YSDTV - REC601 (NTSC)#Y is recommended for
#CNTSC CRT#C users. #YHD TV REC 709#Y is recommended
for #CHD#C and #CUHD/4K#C in #CSDR flat panel TV#C users.
#YsRGB#Y is recommended for #CPC VGA#C and up #CCRT
monitors#C.

White point is normally #YD65#Y (default) for
western regions of all color space types.
#YJapanese SDTV#Y often used #YD93#Y as a white point
(which will appear cooler, or bluer, than #YD65#Y). 

Most gamma calculations normally default to
#CITU-R BT.1886#C, which uses #CDisplay Gamma Power
Law 2.4#C. Your device may have a different native
gamma response, so choose a different Power Law
value if required. #YsRGB#Y has a specific non-linear
gamma that cannot be customized.

Ensure your options chosen here match the test
pattern list you choose in the #C240p Test Suite#C. 

When you are ready to start measuring, click the
#CMeasure#C menu, and select your measurement. If
any large scale changes are made to your display,
it is recommended to re-run a #CGray-scale sweep#C
often, so that baseline calculations can be
accurately made for #CDelta E#C measurements.

A menu will pop up asking you to select a given
#CDVD chapter#C and #Ccolor name#C. Use the #YL#Y and #YR#Y
buttons to scroll through the color list and

select the color desired. Once ready to measure,
click #COK#C in #YHCFR Colormeter#Y to measure
the test pattern.

Use the #CContinuous measure#C mode to be able to
adjust your display's settings to match the
values required for your chosen color space,
white point, gamma, etc.

The #C714mV#C mode will help to find a more accurate
peak white. Do the grayscale and gamma with that,
then turn on #C800mV#C. You might jump up #C30nits#C, but
the color coordinates should be more accurate.
