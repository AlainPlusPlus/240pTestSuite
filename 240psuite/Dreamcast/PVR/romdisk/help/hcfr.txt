                HCFR PATTERNS (1/6)

The #YHCFR Colormeter#Y software allows for profiling
and calibration of displays using the combination
of a pattern generator to create test patterns,
and a tristimulous colorimeter to read and
measure the outputs. Then you, as the user, will
have to change settings on your display in order
to refine the results and attempt to match the
chosen standard of video color reproduction.

The #YHCFR Colormeter#Y software is at the heart
of the system. It interprets the results from the
colorimeter and provides CIE color differences
(Delta E values), chromaticity diagrams, gamma

curves and other values to assist you in
profiling and calibrating your display.

To set up #YHCFR Colormeter#Y, attach your colorimeter
to your computer, open the program, click
#CFile -> New#C, and select "DVD Manual" as your
selected generator. Select your colorimeter
from the list, and click OK.

Once in #YHCFR Colormeter#Y, click
#CAdvance -> Preferences#C.

Under the #C"General"#C tab, ensure that the section
#C"Colors to add when measuring primaries and
secondaries"#C is set to "White". 

Under the #C"References"#C tab, choose your color
space. #C"PAL/SECAM"#C is recommended for #YPAL CRT#Y
users. #C"SDTV - REC601 (NTSC)"#C is recommended for
#YNTSC CRT#Y users. #C"HD TV REC 709"#C is recommended
for #YHD#Y and #YUHD#Y in #YSDR#Y flat panel TV users.
#C"sRGB"#C is recommended for #YPC VGA#Y and up #YCRT
monitors#Y.

White point is normally #YD65#Y (default) for
western regions of all color space types.
#YJapanese SDTV#Y often used #YD93#Y as a white point
(which will appear cooler, or bluer, than #YD65#Y). 

Most gamma calculations normally default to
#CITU-R BT.1886#C, which uses Display Gamma Power
Law 2.4. Your device may have a different native
gamma response, so choose a different Power Law
value if required. #YsRGB#Y has a specific non-linear
gamma that cannot be customized.

Ensure your options chosen here match the test
pattern list you choose in the #Y240p Test Suite#Y. 

When you are ready to start measuring, click the
#C"Measure"#C menu, and select your measurement. If
any large scale changes are made to your display,
it is recommended to re-run a #CGray-scale sweep#C
often, so that baseline calculations can be
accurately made for #CDelta E#C measurements.

A menu will pop up asking you to select a given
DVD chapter and color name. Use the #YL#Y and #YR#Y
buttons to scroll through the color list and

select the color desired. Once ready to measure,
click #C"OK"#C in #YHCFR Colormeter#Y to measure
the test pattern.

Use the #C"Continuous measure"#C mode to be able to
adjust your display's settings to match the
values required for your chosen color space,
white point, gamma, etc.
