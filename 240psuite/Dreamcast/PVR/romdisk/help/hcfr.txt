The #YHCFR Colormeter#Y allows to calibrate a screen
(or projector), this consisting in measuring
displayed color patterns. Then you, users, will
have to change settings and parameters on your
devices to try to refine the results to be as
close as possible to the standard of video color
reproduction.

The #YHCFR Colormeter#Y software is the heart
of the system, it receive the color information
from probes, to treat them. It then allow you to
display various curves and the histograms to
achieve calibrating your setup.
