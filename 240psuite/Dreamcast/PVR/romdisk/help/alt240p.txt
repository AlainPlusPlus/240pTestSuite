              ALTERNATING 240p/480i 

Some devices have a delay when the source changes
between resolutions, which happens in some games.
This test allows to time that delay manually. 

Press #GA#G to switch the resolution; press it again
when you are able to see the screen back in your
display.

Keep in mind that due to the frame buffers this
test takes around 200ms to toggle. you can use
the #CSega Genesis#C, #CSNES#C, #CNED#C, #CPCE#C,
or other non-frame buffer consoles for this if you
need to measure a faster response.
