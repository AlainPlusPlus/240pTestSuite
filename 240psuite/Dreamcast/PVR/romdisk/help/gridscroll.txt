                GRID SCROLL TEST

A grid is scrolled vertically, horizontally or
diagonally which can be used to test linearity of
the signal and how well the display copes
with scrolling and framerate.

The #GX#G button can be used to toggle between
horizontal and vertical, while the d-pad regulates
speed; #GA#G button stops and the #GY#G button changes
direction. 

Diagonal scroll can be enabled with the #GR#G and #GL#G
triggers.
