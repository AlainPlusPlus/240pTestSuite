#GPVR Deflicker Filter:#G Most #CDreamcast#C games used
    this for a stable image on an #Yinterlaced CRT#Y.
    This works by slightly blurring the screen.

#GPVR Texture Dithering:#G Another filter for use
    in composite video signals.

#GUse KOS video defaults:#G Uses #CKallistiOS#C default
    video modes instead of the custom modes.

#GUse KOS register defaults:#G Uses #CKallistiOS#C default
    register values instead of the custom ones.

#GEnable PAL Modes:#G These can only be enabled in
    #CDreamcasts#C with #YEuropean Flash ROM#Y, since
    NTSC #CDC#C output a corrupt PAL signal.

#GEnable PAL Background:#G Since most of the menus
    and screens are designed for 240p, this fills
    the borders with the selected color, however
    there are specific PAL patterns that do not 
    need this, such as grids and overscan.

#GChange PAL Background:#G Select the fill color for
    the PAL background.

#GPAL starting line:#G PAL specifies the start of
    active video at line 23 (Top), this setting
    allows centering the active video lines in the
    signal or moving it to the bottom. This allows
    using the suite to calibrate and check overscan
    even if the #CDC#C cannot output the full PAL
    resolution.
                
#G480p Scanline Intensity:#G When in line doubled
    480p mode, the suite allows the display of
    rendered scanlines. This determines the alpha
    value for them, 0% eliminates them.

#G480p Scanlines:#G This setting allows the display
    or EVEN or ODD scanline display in 480p line
    doubled mode.

#GSave Options to VMU:#G Saves current options to
    #CVMU#C. They are auto loaded at start if a save
    is found. Save requires 2 free blocks. (Press
    L or R trigger to use the hidden eye-catchers,
    11 blocks needed). Icons are random.

#GLoad Options from VMU:#G Loads options from the #CVMU#C.

#GApproximate 714.3mV IRE:#G Since the #CDreamcast#C
video output is slightly high at #C800mV#C, we 
created an option to limit selected color and B&W
patterns to a level that approximates #C714.3mV#C.

This option defines the default value when using
such patterns. It is displayed in the #CVMU#C or it
can be toggled by pressing #GY#Y on those patterns.
Please keep in mind that in some professional and
consumer video equipment, the amplitude is
adjusted by the #Ycolor burst#Y, and in such scenarios
it is best to leave this at #C800mV#C.

#GReset all options to defaults:#G Resets all.
