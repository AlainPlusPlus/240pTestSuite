                 Controller Test

This test shows the controller inputs from all
four controllers ports at once.

The test only shows the reported controller
functions by default, but by pressing #YRight+Start#Y
you can display all possible inputs in order to
test some non-compliant implementations or
duplicated outputs, like some light guns.

Keyboards are also supported by default, and you
can type a few lines to text.

You can exit by pressing #YLeft+Start#Y.
