                 Controller Test

This test shows the controller inputs from all
four controllers at once.

The test only shows the reported controller
functions by default, but by pressing #YRight+Start#Y
you can display all possible inputs in order to
test some non-compliant implementations or
duplicated outputs.

You can exit by pressing #YLeft+Start#Y.
