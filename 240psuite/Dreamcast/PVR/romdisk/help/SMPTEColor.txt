              SMPTE COLOR BARS (1/4)

This pattern can be used to calibrate for NTSC
levels regarding contrast and brightness, and 
appropriate colors as well. 

You can toggle between 100% and 75% SMPTE color 
with #GA#G. Last screen has a #Yvectorscope#Y image.

Remember that the black level in the SMPTE pattern
refers to 7.5 IRE for video, console games usually
start at 0 IRE. This pattern can be used to 
calibrate colors and then black levels can
be adjusted with the PLUGE pattern using the #GFull 
RGB Mode#G.

              SMPTE COLOR BARS (2/4)

In an SMPTE color bar image, the top two-thirds
of the television picture contain seven vertical
bars of 75% intensity. In order from left to
right, the colors are gray, yellow, cyan, green,
magenta, red, and blue.

This sequence runs through all seven possible
combinations that use at least one of the three
basic color components of green, red, and blue,
with blue cycling on and off between every bar,
red cycling on and off every two bars, and green
on for the leftmost four bars and off for the
rightmost three.

              SMPTE COLOR BARS (3/4)

Below the main set of seven bars is a strip of 
blue, magenta, cyan, and white castellations. 
When a television receiver is set to filter out 
all colors except for blue, these castellations, 
combined with the main set of color bars, are 
used to properly adjust the color controls; they
appear as four solid blue bars, with no visible 
distinction between the bars and the 
castellations, if the color controls are properly
adjusted.
