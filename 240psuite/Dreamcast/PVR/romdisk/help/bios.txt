              BIOS & FLASHROM DATA

This screen shows the #CBIOS#C, #CCRC#C, #CIC name#C and a
description if recognized. If it is not reported
and you believe it should be added, please contact
me to add the new CRC to the list.

Factory data from the #Yflashrom#Y is also displayed,
like serials, manufacturing date, etc.

The #Cbackup flashrom#C can be displayed with #YX#Y.

You can scroll the list with the #YD-pad#Y or analog
controller in case it is too long.

Data from the service area #C(CID)#C of the flashrom
can be displayed by pressing the #YY#Y button.
