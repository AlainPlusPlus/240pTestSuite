                 COLORBARS (1/2)

This pattern allows you to calibrate each color:
#RRed#R, #GGreen#G and #BBlue#B; as well as the white level.

This is adjusted in the same way black levels
are set with the #CPLUGE#C. If you adjusted the black
level correctly with the #CPLUGE#C, the rectangles 
under the #Y1#Y column should be barely visible.

Adjust the white level first, this is done using
the #CContrast#C control on your TV set. Raise it
until you cannot distinguish between the two
blocks under #YF#Y, and lower it slowly until you
can clearly tell them apart.          
                                      #C(cont...)#C
                 COLORBARS (2/2)

You can highlight the blocks for 2 seconds with #YX#Y.

The same procedure should be used with each
color, raise the control that adjusts the
individual color level (not the #Ccolor#C/#Ctint#C one)
until you can't tell the rightmost box under #YF#Y
from the one to its left, and then lower it until
you can distinguish them clearly. 

The same bars with a grid pattern are available
with the #YA#Y button.

Use zoomed-in lower and higher color patterns with
#YL#Y and #YR#Y when using the default view.
