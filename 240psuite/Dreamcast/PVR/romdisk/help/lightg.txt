                 LIGHT GUN TEST

Here you can check how a lightgun is performing.

In the first screen, you need to point around the
top corners and left edge of the screen in order
to calibrate the limits of the sensors.

After the limits are detected, a message will be
shown at the bottom of the screen and the
coordinates will be screen mapped. Then you must
press #YB#Y to continue.

In the next screen, the cursor will follow your
aim. If wish to return to the calibration screen,
you can improve it by pressing #YB#Y again.

Have fun!
