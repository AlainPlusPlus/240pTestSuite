# Build Instructions

In order to build the 240pSuite for Genesis/MegaDrive download the
SGDK 1.11 repo from 2014 located at: 

https://github.com/ArtemioUrbina/SGDK_1_11_Suite

Please change the sgdk.bat file to point to your installation
and run the compile_genesis.bat file from the 240p test suite
folder


For Sega CD, you should update the SCD_LOADER path in the
sgdk.bat file to point to the suitable folder (included in the
240p test suite for genesis) and then run the compile_segaCD.bat
file from the 240p test suite folder
