   EBU/SMPTE COLOR BARS (1/3)

This pattern can be used to
calibrate for #CPAL#C/#CNTSC#C levels
regarding contrast and
brightness, and appropiate colors
as well.

You can toggle between #Y100%#Y and
#Y75%#Y levels by pressing #CA#C.

The #CEBU#C color bars start at 0mV.

Remember that the black level in
the #CSMPTE#C pattern refers to #Y7.5IRE#Y
for video, console games usually
start at #Y0IRE#Y. This pattern can
be used to calibrate colors - or
auto calibrated in a professional
display - and then black levels
can be adjusted with the #CPLUGE#C
pattern using the #GFull RGB Mode#G.

   EBU/SMPTE COLOR BARS (2/3)

In an #CSMPTE#C color bar image, the
top two-thirds of the television
picture contain seven vertical
bars of #Y75%#Y intensity. In
order from left to right, the
colors are gray, yellow, cyan,
green, magenta, red, and blue.

This sequence runs through all
seven possible combinations that
use at least one of the three
basic color components of green,
red, and blue, with blue cycling
on and off between every bar, red
cycling on and off every two
bars, and green on for the
leftmost four bars and off for
the rightmost three.

   EBU/SMPTE COLOR BARS (3/3)

Below the main set of seven bars
is a strip of blue, magenta, cyan,
and white castellations.

When a television receiver is set
to filter out all colors except
for blue, these castellations,
combined with the main set of
color bars, are used to properly
adjust the color controls; they
appear as four solid blue bars,
with no visible distinction
between the bars and the
castellations, if the color
controls are properly adjusted.
