            OVERSCAN

With this pattern you can
interactively find out the
overscan in pixels and percentage
of each edge in a display.

Use the #GR#G and #GL#G buttons to
increment the overscan until you
see the white border, then go 
back one pixel. The resulting
number is the amount of overscan
in pixels in each direction.

You can use 480i for an accurate
readout, since 240p is just 320
pixels wide, while 480i is 640.
