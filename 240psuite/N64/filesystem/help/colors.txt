         COLORBARS (1/2)

This pattern allows you to
calibrate each color: Red, Green
and Blue; as well as white level.

The default pattern shows 32 pure
shades of each color, but the N64 
is has 256 available in 32bpp.
You can view the last and first
32 by pressing #CL#C or #CR#C. An extra
pattern is also available with a
white grid as background by
pressing #CA#C.

This is adjusted in the same way
black levels are set with the
#GPLUGE#G. If you adjusted the black
level correctly with the PLUGE,
the rectangles under the #G1#G column
should be barely visible.

         COLORBARS (2/2)

Adjust the white level first,
this is done using the #YContrast#Y
control on your TV set. Raise it
until you cannot distinguish
between the two blocks under #GF#G,
and lower it slowly until you can
clearly tell them apart.

The same procedure should be used
with each color, raise the control
that adjusts the individual color
level (not the #Ycolor#Y/#Ytint#Y one)
until you can't tell the rightmost
box under #GF#G from the one to its
left, and then lower it until you
can distinguish them clearly. 

Repeat for each color and you are
set.
