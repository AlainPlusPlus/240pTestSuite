           HELP (1/2)

The 240p Test Suite was designed
with two goals in mind:

1) Evaluate 240p signal display
modern TV sets and video
processing equipment; and 

2) Provide calibration patterns
generated on your game console
to help in properly calibrating
the display's black, white and
color levels.

Help and options are available
everywhere by pressing #CStart#C.

This version of the suite
supports 240p, 288p, 576i and
480i video modes.

The #YNintendo 64#Y cuts out a
few pixels on all sides of the
screen. Affected patterns show
a warning screen regarding this
issue.

PAL modes must be enabled from
the options menu, but only 480
lines are visible.

The 240p suite is also available
in: #YSega Genesis#Y, #YSega CD#Y, #YPCE#Y,
#YSNES#Y, #YNES#Y, #YGC#Y, #YWii#Y, #YDC#Y, etc.
